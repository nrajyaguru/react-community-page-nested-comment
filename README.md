> git clone https://github.com/nrajyaguru/public.git

> git checkout Assignment

> npm install (Assuming node is installed)

> npm run dev


## Assumption


>  Material-UI is used a styling library

>  No limit on nested comments - Dynamic in nature (Configurable for future using config)

>  Using material components and setup to have responsive UI

>  Used out of the box configuration of MUI compoenents for styling as needed

>  Choosen to have data structure for handling post simple to have array of post and further each post contains title, content & comments array

>  If extended in future, this data structure can be adjusted to have better performance using flat structure instead of nested structure
