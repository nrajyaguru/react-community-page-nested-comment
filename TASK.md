# Task Overview
Create a Community Page (Frontend Only) with the following features

1. Post Creation:
Allow users to create a new post.

2. Comments on Posts:
Allow users to comment under a post.

3. Nested Comments:
Users can add comments under other comments (nested structure).

4. View Existing Data:
Display a small set of mock posts and comments so the page looks populated.

## Requirements
 
> Use React with TypeScript.

> Styling can be done in CSS or SCSS (preference is SCSS for modularity).

> Keep the codebase clean with appropriate separation of concerns (e.g., components, hooks, utilities).

> Comments should be displayed in a nested structure with clear distinction between levels (e.g., using indentation or visual hierarchy).

> Focus on quality over quantity of the code. We expect clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

> You are welcome to use UI libraries like Material-UI (MUI) or other packages to enhance the development process.

> Be prepared to explain some of your structural decisions within the React repository.

## Deliverables

> Functional frontend of the community page.

> Code should be submitted via a public GitHub or GitLab repository with clear README instructions on running the project locally.

> Use of mock data (JSON or array of items) to simulate existing posts and commentsâ€”no backend required.

> Comments in the code where necessary to explain functionality or design choices.

## Evaluation Criteria

> Quality of code (readability, modularity, and maintainability).

> Proper use of TypeScript for type safety.
User experience (UI/UX design and responsiveness).

> Adherence to best practices in React, CSS/SCSS, and any additional libraries used.
